
Introduction:  yacas is a free computer algrebra
system (CAS).  Ryacas is an R interface that
allows one to send R expressions or unprocessed
yacas strings to yacas from R and get back the
result as an S3 object containing an R expression
(and other formats).

It can be used for exact arithmetic, symbolic
math, ASCII pretty printing and translating R to
TeX.  (See examples below.)

The Ryacas home page is at:
http://code.google.com/p/ryacas/

Technology:  Internally it communicates via
sockets with a separate yacas process and performs
a direct translation of R to yacas in one
direction and uses a yacas XML-based OpenMath
format in the other direction.  The output is an
S3 object usually containing the result in both R
expression and XML formats.  The idea of a
separate yacas process is that eventually it might
be possible to have yacas run on a remote high
power compute server while R runs locally on a low
powered PC.

Installation: On Windows the R package
distribution contains everything needed including
a copy of yacas 1.0.61.  Just perform a normal R
package install and run.  On other systems one
must install yacas 1.0.61 or 1.0.62 in the usual 
way first.

Status: The package is subject to change.

R Interface: The yacas R function will accept a
raw yacas input string, an R expression or a one
line R function. If the input is not already a raw
yacas input string it is converted prior to
sending it to yacas. The yacas function outputs
the result as an R expression or in various other
formats. The Sym function provides an alternate
interface such that, e.g. x <- Sym('x'), produces
a Sym variable. Such Sym variables can be
processed with the usual +, -, *, / etc. operators
as well as a variety of commands that mimic yacas.
There is a vignette with examples of the R yacas
function interface:
http://ryacas.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/inst/doc/Ryacas.pdf
and an analogous vignette that redoes all the same
examples using the Sym interface:
http://ryacas.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/inst/doc/Ryacas-Sym.pdf
A few examples are also shown below.

Thank you for using yacas
