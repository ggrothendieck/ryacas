
Ryacas is an R interface to the free yacas
computer algebra system. Ryacas allows one to send
R expressions or unprocessed yacas strings to a
separate yacas process from R and get back the
result.  It also has facilities for manipulating
yacas strings and R expressions destined for yacas
processing.

It can be used for exact arithmetic, symbolic
math, ASCII pretty printing and translating R to
TeX.
