
Introduction.  yacas is a free computer algrebra
system (CAS).  Ryacas is an R interface that
allows one to send R expressions or unprocessed 
yacas strings to yacas from R and get back the
result as an S3 object containing an R expression
(and other formats).

It can be used for exact arithmetic, symbolic
math, ASCII pretty printing and translating
R to TeX.  (See examples below.)

Technology.  Internally it communicates via
sockets with a separate yacas process and performs
a direct translation of R to yacas in one
direction and uses a yacas XML-based OpenMath format 
in the other direction.  The output is an S3 object
usually containing the result in both R expression and 
XML formats.  The idea of a separate yacas process is that
eventually it might be possible to have yacas run
on a remote high power compute server while R runs
locally on a low powered PC.

Installation. On Windows the R package distribution 
contains everything needed.  Just perform a normal
R package install and run.  On other systems one 
must install yacas 1.0.62 in the usual way first.

Status. The package is subject to change.
