WISHLIST

o debug the S4 interface

o check out the following in case there is something useful for us:
	http://alphatcl.sourceforge.net/wikit/182

o echo x*x | yacas -pc does not seem to work on Windows preventing
  method = "system" from working.  This needs to be fixed,
  at least on Windows.

o ensure examples work at http://yacas.sourceforge.net/intromanual.html

o There is some 'syntax mapping' yet to be done, e.g.
        atan2

o do not work:

       yacas(expression((x+y)^3-(x-y)^3))
       yacas(expression(Simplify(%))) 
       # yacas("Simplify(%)") does work, is that sufficient?

       yacas(expression(20!))  
       # yacas(expression(factorial(10))) does work, is that sufficient?

o non-R syntax expressions: e.g. 20! is not a valid R expression (however, yacas(expression(factorial(10))) works, is that not good enough?).
 a yepression() function which does not try to evaluate its argument
  as R expression but simply checks if the argument is a valid yacas
  expression?

o a function like deriv which exists in yacas and R but with different
  syntax??

o documentation: vignette

o documentation: help
